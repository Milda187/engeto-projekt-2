      <h2 class="h2-about-hockey">About hockey</h2>
      <p>
         Ice hockey is a team sport played on ice. It is one of the fastest sports in the world. 
         Players on skates reach high speeds, and the shot puck sometimes exceeds the speed of 175 km/h. 
         Hockey originated at the end of the 19th century in Canada 
         (the rules were created in Montréal in 1878), but it soon spread to Europe 
         (mainly northern and central) and later partly to Asia. 
         The first record of a hockey game, held at a known place and time, 
         with a recorded result between two teams, took place on March 3, 
         1875 in Montreal at the Victoria Skating Rink.

<!-- *************************** GAME SECTION *************************** -->
<section class="game-section">
   <div class="mobile-content desktop-content">
      <h2 class="h2-game">Game</h2>
      <p>
         Ice hockey is played in 3 periods of 20 minutes each, i.e. 60 minutes of pure time in total 
         (i.e. time stops during interruptions). There are two breaks between periods, each lasting 15 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
         It is played on a hockey field, where six players for each team take to the ice, 
         all players have skates and hockey sticks. The goal of the game is to score more 
         goals than your opponent. It is played with a small, hard rubber disc called a puck. 
         Players control the puck with long sticks with blades called hockey sticks. 
         The hockey stick is curved at its lower end. Players can also change the direction 
         of the puck with their body, including hands or skates. Two exceptions apply. 
         The first is the prohibition of passing the puck with your hand to your teammate 
         outside the defensive zone. And secondly, they may not shoot the puck into the 
         goal intentionally with anything other than a hockey stick. One of the six players 
         is the goalkeeper, whose main task is not to let the puck into the goal. 
         The goalie has special equipment and special rights, such as the ability to cover 
         the puck to stop play. Each team can have a maximum of 22 players on the roster 
         (however, they can have an unlimited number of players on the roster), of which 
         2 are goalkeepers. Substitution of players is possible at any time during the 
         game with one exception. The team that drops the puck on a prohibited release or 
         icing may not make a substitution before the restart of the game.
      </p>
      <p>
         The remaining five players are divided into three attackers and two defenders. 
         The attacking positions are left wing, center forward (centre) and right wing. 
         Forwards usually play together in forward lines (colloquially lines ), 
         where there are always three forwards together. Often the entire five players 
         are replaced at once. The optimal length of one rotation is 30 seconds. 
         Most teams play four offensive lines and three defensive pairings. 
         However, this may vary from country to country.
      </p>
      <p>
         Referees are an important part of the game. There are usually four - two main 
         and two linemen. The main referees are responsible for the regularity 
         of the game - they assess fouls and award penalties. A minor penalty lasts 2 minutes, 
         a major penalty 5 minutes and a personal penalty 10 minutes. Penalties can be 
         combined (eg: 2+5, 5 + until the end of the match).
      </p>
      <p>
         The guardrails around the court help to keep the puck in play, and thanks to them, 
         the game often lasts for several minutes without interruption. When play is stopped, 
         the throw-in continues . In hockey, there are three basic rules that limit the movement 
         of the puck. It is forbidden to release , toss the puck out of the ice area and to stand 
         out of play . Compliance with these rules is overseen by line judges.
      </p>
      <p>
         The remaining features of the game are largely dependent on the exact rules that are used. 
         The two most important are from the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) and from 
         the North American NHL, which is considered the best professional league in the world. 
         The rules of Czech hockey are practically identical to the rules of the IIHF.

         There are two standard sizes for hockey rinks: one used primarily in North America, 
         also known as NHL size, the other used in Europe and international competitions, 
         also known as IIHF or Olympic size.

            <h3 class="international-h3">International</h3> 
            <p>
            Hockey rinks in the rest of the world follow the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) 
            specifications, which are 60.0 by 30.0 metres (196.9 ft × 98.4 ft) with a corner radius 
            of 8.5 metres (27.9 ft). The two goal lines are 4.0 metres (13.1 ft) from the end boards, 
            and the blue lines are 22.86 metres (75.0 ft) from the end boards.

            <p>
            Most North American rinks follow the National Hockey League (NHL) specifications of 200 by 85 feet 
            (61.0 by 25.9 m) with a corner radius of 28 feet (8.5 m). Each goal line is 11 feet (3.4 m) 
            from the end boards. NHL blue lines are 75 feet (22.9 m) from the end boards and 50 feet (15.2 m) 
            apart. The 13.4-foot (4.09 m) difference in width from the international standard represents a 
            significant difference in width-to-length ratio on the ice.

            A puck (sometimes also called a puck or simply a disc ) is a small object in the shape 
            of a very flat cylinder, which is used to play ice hockey. 
            The puck has a diameter of approximately 76.2  millimeters 
            (3  inches of English measure), a height of 25.4 mm (1 inch of English measure) and  
            a weight of 156 to 170 grams. Pucks are often marked with silkscreened team or 
            league logos on one or both faces. Pucks are frozen before the game 
            to reduce bouncing during play.

      <h3 class="desktop-czechia-hockey-2">The Czech Republic men's national ice hockey team</h3>
      <p>The Czech national team was formed following the breakup of Czechoslovakia, 
         as the country was split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia. 
         The Czech Republic was recognized as the successor to Czechoslovakia and 
         retained in the highest pool (A), while Slovakia was required start international 
         play in pool C. See also Post-Cold War period of the IIHF world championships.</p>
      <p>
         The Czechs won the gold medal at the 1998 Winter Olympics and won three straight 
         gold medals at the world championships from 1999 to 2001. In the next three 
         years, the team did not get a medal at the world championships—not even home at 
         the 2004 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships held in Prague and Ostrava, thus 
         keeping the "world championship home ice curse" alive. The following year, however, 
         the Czechs won gold at the 2005 tournament, the only world championship where, due 
         to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, all NHL players were available to participate.
      </p>
      <p>
         At the 2006 Winter Olympics, the Czechs won a bronze medal, defeating Russia 3–0 
         (roster) in the bronze medal game. At the 2006 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships, 
         the Czechs earned silver, falling to Sweden in the final, the only time the Czechs have 
         lost the final game of the tournament. The Czech Republic won the 2010 World Championships 
         in Germany. For the first time in history, the Czech Republic did not qualify for the 
         quarterfinals at the 2022 Winter Olympics and finished in ninth place, their lowest 
         placement in history.[12] However, they won a bronze medal at the 2022 IIHF World 
         Championship later the same year, ending its longest medal drought in IIHF tournaments 
         history, which had lasted since 2012. In 2023, the Czech Republic finished in eighth 
         place at the World Championship, which is the worst placement in history. At the 2024 
         IIHF World Championship, they ended their 14-year gold drought after winning it for the 
         first time since 2010, also as hosts.
